# <HORISEON-ACCESSIBILITY>

## Description

https://sam-antics.github.io/horiseon-accessibility/

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## List of Changes

- Added semantic HTML tags
- Reordered style.css contents to follow HTML organization
- Corrected broken page navigation

## Still to Do

- add alt statements for images
- review the "float" classes. See if there's a more efficient way to do this in the CSS file.


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
